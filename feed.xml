This advice is mostly for academic and career success. This means that other very important aspects of university life, like socializing and managing your physical and mental health are not covered as much, even though they are equally as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advice throughout follows some common themes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surround yourself with the right people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think ahead: anticipate your future needs early. Even if you don’t know what you want, you can maximize your future opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gain as much career-relevant experience as you can, as fast as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize your needs and manage your time properly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;applying-to-waterloo&quot;&gt;Applying To Waterloo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right program is a very personal question and there’s no right answer. However, there is an optimal way to &lt;em&gt;apply&lt;/em&gt; to programs at Waterloo. This is because it is easier to switch from a more competitive program to a less competitive one (or get rejected from a competitive program and still receive an alternate offer). The best strategy, then, is to apply to the most competitive programs, even if you think you might want to be in a less competitive one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit of competitive programs is not the courses you get to take. It’s the network of incredibly hard-working and intelligent peers you will get access to. It’s crucial to surround yourself with friends who you can get help from for assignments and job hunting. Even if you think a program like Software Engineering is too much work for you, you will have the flexibility to opt out. Keep your options open, and try out the more competitive program. You can even make your most important friendships in a hard program and then switch to an easier program, giving you the best from both programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;choosing-residences-courses-co-op-streams&quot;&gt;Choosing Residences, Courses, Co-op Streams&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose stream 8 if you can:&lt;/strong&gt; Getting 8 months of school before your first co-op is strictly better than only getting 4 months. Employers prefer students who have had more school, and it is easier for you to adjust to university life without immediately needing to job hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose apartment-style residences:&lt;/strong&gt; The main critique of apartment-style residences is that it’s easier to be social in a dorm. Personally I had no problem socializing, and apartments are undeniably higher-quality living situations. It’s easier to get apartment-style if you have a group to live with beforehand. I would avoid getting a meal plan, which is just a way of forcing you to spend money; dorms have mandatory meal plans while suites typically have the option of no meal plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing courses:&lt;/strong&gt; Your courses are a personal choice based on your ambitions and how much work load you want to take on. That said, you should go through the required courses for your program as early as possible. You don’t want to get stuck in a situation where you find your schedule in 4th year does not allow you to take the courses you need to graduate, delaying your graduation. This can happen due to not having pre-reqs to take courses, or it can happen because certain courses are only offered in certain terms. Getting requirements out of the way early lets you have more flexibility in the future. Look up which terms (winter, spring, or fall) the courses you want and need to take are offered. Plan out your schedules for future terms ahead of time, as soon as you know what courses you will be taking. You can schedule some time with an academic advisor to go over your plan and verify it meets your program’s requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting note for CS courses: Algorithms and Operating Systems are the two major third-year courses that bottleneck your ability to take fourth-year courses. You can fast-track one of them based on your interests, by delaying any pre-reqs for one but not the other. I recommend taking Algorithms earlier, since the concepts there are more useful for technical interviews. You can also look into fast-tracking your statistics courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;succeeding-at-your-courses&quot;&gt;Succeeding At Your Courses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use UWFlow:&lt;/strong&gt; UWFlow is an amazing tool that does a lot for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best way to explore which courses to take (shows you which courses you meet the pre-reqs for, course schedules, how easy and useful people found courses, which courses your friends have taken, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exports your course schedule for you, so you can have your schedule in your favourite calendar app automatically (I prefer Google Calendar)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a wishlist of courses you want to consider for the future&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go over the syllabus and put everything in your calendar:&lt;/strong&gt; Assignment due dates, midterms, office hours, everything. The goal is to expect how busy you’ll get throughout the term, so nothing catches you by surprise. You should also know all of Waterloo’s important dates: &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/important-dates/calendar&quot;&gt;https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/important-dates/calendar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimize your course schedule:&lt;/strong&gt; Use RateMyProf and UWFlow to make sure you are in the course sections with the best professor. The professor is much more important than the time or location of the section. You can usually attend a different section even if you are not enrolled, unless too many people do the same thing. When this happens, you may get your ID checked. Be ready to change your schedule as soon as you are able to (look up what dates course selection are); it’s much harder to change later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate on assignments:&lt;/strong&gt; Make friends with others taking the same courses as you, and never submit an assignment without collaborating with friends. This doesn’t mean copying answers; it means verifying that you are understanding the course materials correctly before losing out on marks rather than after. Seriously, no copying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to office hours:&lt;/strong&gt; One-on-one help from the professor or TA will usually spell out for you how to do an assignment or understand an example. Don’t waste hours being stuck on one part of an assignment; usually you just need one quick hint to finish the question quickly. You should attempt the assignment before going to office hours in order to have specific questions to ask. In fact, treat the office hours before an assignment is due as a soft deadline for the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take organized notes:&lt;/strong&gt; Basically, copy word for word what the prof writes down on the board. If your prof does not write everything down or writes things in a disorganized way, perhaps you have a bad prof. If you have no alternative, you may need to take some extra time to organize the ideas and examples into a way that makes more sense to you after class. Alternatively, you can see if there are course materials on Learn (like a textbook or slide decks) and write notes that summarize those materials instead. Worst case, Google the course and see if you can find old course notes shared by past students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Quick shoutout to Anthony Zhang’s notes: https://anthony-zhang.me/University-Notes/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just skip class if you’re extremely confident the course materials are sufficient for you. Regardless, always take notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study effectively:&lt;/strong&gt; My personal method for studying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarize all your notes:&lt;/strong&gt; Go over your notes and concisely but thoroughly cover every major concept. If you need to, cross reference your notes with other course materials. Of course, omit any notes that you have been told will not be on the exam. The goal is to make the shortest possible cheat sheet that, if you knew everything covered in it, you would get 100% on the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go over assignments, practice exams, and past exams (in that order):&lt;/strong&gt; Redo all your assignments; try to do them with as little help from your cheat sheet as possible. Reference the answer sheet after you’ve given your best try. Edit your cheat sheet as needed if you find anything missing. Repeat this process for practice exams and past exams. Ideally by the end, you will not need to reference your cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for help:&lt;/strong&gt; Only after doing the above steps should you study with friends or go to office hours. Ask about specific questions you were unable to do on your own and specific concepts you could not understand from your notes. Help your friends: you will know you are ready if you can teach your friend any concept. Compare cheat sheets and see if you all agree on what will be covered on the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good study spots:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The criteria for a good study spot:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Appropriate noise level (for group studying or solo studying)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not too crowded&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Roomy table space&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Accessibility to outlets and nice washrooms&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some good study spots (some are more hidden gems than others):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;E6 soft seating across from the elevators (go to any upper floor)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Laurier Library and other Laurier buildings (way less crowded than Waterloo! But not always open 24/7)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tatham Centre (when it’s not busy during interview season, you can book an entire room)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;M3 study lounge and upper floors&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DC or DP libraries I guess…&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Join a club; clubs have the ability to reserve rooms&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certain residences, programs, and student housing have study lounges&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MC Tutorial Lounge&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Quiet areas in upper floors of MC&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand what works for you:&lt;/strong&gt; Be critical of how your note-taking, studying, class attendance, and etc. factor into your success, because it’s heavily dependent on you as an individual. Explore whether you take notes better on paper vs laptop. How should you format your notes for your future self? Do you learn better from lectures or from reading a textbook? Figure out your preferences early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;read-evys-guide-to-internships&quot;&gt;Read Evy’s Guide to Internships&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cover many of the same topics in this post, but Evy goes into a lot more detail here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://evykassirer.github.io/playing-the-internship-game/&quot;&gt;https://evykassirer.github.io/playing-the-internship-game/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gain-coding-experience---the-first-step-to-building-a-great-tech-resume&quot;&gt;Gain Coding Experience - The First Step To Building a Great Tech Resume&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have high quality experience on your resume, no amount of wordsmithing or hyperbole is going to impress an employer. If you’re like most first-years, you have little to no experience to fill out even a one-page resume. &lt;strong&gt;Start gaining experience as soon as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; There are many ways to do this: work on a side project, join a coding club, go to a hackathon, practice/participate in coding competitions, or contribute to open source. Try out each of these methods, and stick with the ones that you find most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a side project:&lt;/strong&gt; This is difficult for first-years since you’ll have little coding experience and you also need to come up with an interesting idea that will motivate you to see it through to completion. Keep in mind the originality of the idea is not that important. You can even completely copy an existing app that you really like. What’s important is that you find the motivation to complete the app, and  you learn a lot from the process of working on the project. Side projects are best suited for you if you enjoy product design. An easy first side project is to make a portfolio website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join a tech club:&lt;/strong&gt; This option is great because it also helps you meet new people. The most obvious club you’d first look into is Computer Science Club. &lt;em&gt;Do not join Computer Science Club.&lt;/em&gt; I recommend joining clubs that are trying to complete a project within the term. This time constraint almost guarantees that you will get something impressive to put on your resume. Time constraints are also beneficial because these clubs will need to be more selective of its members, which helps you find mentors and friends who will support you with school and jobs. Any club that meets this criteria is a good bet, but the clubs/residences I have in mind are Hack The North, UW Blueprint, and Velocity Residence. Apply to a club/residence like these right away, because they recruit before the term starts. Despite being selective, these clubs highly value developing the skills of less experienced students, so your chances of getting in are better than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to a hackathon:&lt;/strong&gt; A hackathon is a 24- or 36-hour event where participants form teams of 1-4 and build a project idea entirely during the time of the event. The goal is to have enough of the product built so that they can demo it to a pane of judges. A select few teams are chosen as winners. This is not much different that starting a side project, but hackathons help motivate you, provide mentors, and you can even join a team with a cool idea if you can’t come up with your own. Go with ambitious friends - surviving a hackathon together really brings people closer together. The best hackathon in Waterloo is Hack the North, but there are plenty of others like TerribleHack and EngHack, as well as hackathons hosted at other universities or by tech companies. The best way to learn about hackathons is making friends with people who go to hackathons. Hackathons often pay for the cost of transportation and provide food and free swag throughout the event. Some hackathons even provide fun break activities like therapy puppies or juggling lessons, or mini coding competitions. Hackathons can be a great opportunity to network with peers and employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding Competitions:&lt;/strong&gt; This option is appealing because it both builds your resume and is practice for technical interviews at the same time. The best websites for coding challenges are HackerRank and LeetCode. I will cover how to get the most out of these websites in this post’s section on Practicing for Interviews, but I encourage you to save the code you write, host it somewhere like Github, and link to it on your resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contribute to open source:&lt;/strong&gt; Open source projects on Github always have tasks that they want people to do. As you use open source tools, you may likely find a bug or feature that you yourself can submit a change for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be an undergraduate research assistant:&lt;/strong&gt; This option is best suited for if you are considering pursuing a Masters or PhD. You get to collaborate with a prof on their research project, you get paid, and you are eligible for a small scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;writing-your-resume&quot;&gt;Writing Your Resume&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tech industry, a resume should be one page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The format I recommend:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your name in a large font&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; your personal website, your Github account, LinkedIn, and email (get started on making all of these!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Languages: programming languages. Put any down if you’ve used them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Technologies: specific frameworks or tools you’ve used.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Algorithms: This section is optional. Remember when I said you should save your solutions to HackerRank and LeetCode problems? Link to it here.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; All your past tech internships. Only put non-tech jobs if you really can’t fill up your resume any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects:&lt;/strong&gt; Your side projects, open source contributions, hackathon projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other, as needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe you have research experience, or participated in a coding competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education:&lt;/strong&gt; The least important section, since you can’t really differentiate yourself here. But still include it, because employers need to know what program you’re in and when you expect to graduate&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For each past experience (whether it be work, research or a project):&lt;/strong&gt; use point-form to detail what you did. It is important to highlight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What did you make&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did you make it (what tools; which parts of the tech stack)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is this impressive (did you earn any prize or other form of recognition from this experience? what was its effect on real people? did it make/save money? why was it challenging?) If possible, quantify why this is impressive (e.g. made a process 50% faster, or acquired 500 users).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep the points concise. Set a one or two line limit for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to improve your resume (besides gaining more experience) is to &lt;strong&gt;look up the resumes of Waterloo students with good careers&lt;/strong&gt; (they’ll usually link to it on their personal websites). Analyze the format they use, how they word their bullet points, and so on. Keep an eye out for on-campus resume critiques run by more experienced students. They are usually shared on Facebook, or on posters around campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;applying-for-jobs&quot;&gt;Applying for Jobs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waterloo uses a tool called WaterlooWorks for you to manage your job applications. You have a limit of 50 applications in the first round. 50 is a lot. The less experience you have, the less selective you should be, so in first-year, use all 50. There are multiple rounds of job postings: first round (the most important round when all the best companies hire), second round, and continuous round (when you basically have unlimited applications). Note that any rejections you get from your first round of applications actually replenishes your number of applications, as long as the second round hasn’t ended. Apply to some jobs that you don’t have the requirements for. You should still have plenty of applications after this to apply to jobs with requirements that sound like they fit your experience. Your experience does not need to perfectly match the job posting’s requirements; be ambitious. Often, I’ve heard students scared of applying to jobs they aren’t sure they’re qualified for because they’re afraid of failing the interview. But getting hard interviews is exactly what will help you get better at interviews in the future. Don’t be afraid to fail interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unless you have other very positive signals, avoid applying to places that no friend or friend of friend has ever worked at:&lt;/strong&gt; The best way to know if a company is good is through testimonials from people you trust. This is why it’s important to make good friends - chances are a friend of a friend has worked at any given company. You could even try asking the company to connect you with a past/current intern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When are other positive signals for a company?&lt;/strong&gt; To answer this, you need to research the company much like how a venture capitalist would before investing. Unlike a venture capitalist, you have much less resources at your disposal. See who the company’s investors are (do these investors have a good track record?), the resumes of employees at the company, and how well they pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postings with few applications should be avoided:&lt;/strong&gt; You can see how many other students have applied to a posting. It can be tempting to use that number to apply to jobs with less competition, but really this is just a sign that you should likely avoid the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All else equal, prefer companies that will have multiple interns:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a great way to make friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to info sessions:&lt;/strong&gt; Learn more about what a company is like, get free food and swag. Bring a physical resume to give to the speakers. Look at the info session calendar and add all the interesting ones to your calendar app. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ceca.uwaterloo.ca/students/sessions.php&quot;&gt;Click here to see UWaterloo’s info session calendar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jobs in the US are generally more desirable:&lt;/strong&gt; The tech industry is simply more competitive in the US. Even if you prefer staying in Canada, a job in the US will make getting future jobs easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid returning to the same company:&lt;/strong&gt; Co-op is an amazing opportunity for you to try out different companies. Each new experience gives you a better resume to get an even better experience next co-op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other networking and recruiting events:&lt;/strong&gt; Besides info sessions, companies tend to throw events such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Women in Tech socials&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Office tours&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech talks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Google Tech Challenge! This is an incredibly fun event held every year at Google’s Waterloo office.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/events/tech-challenge/#!?detail-content-tabby_activeEl=about&quot;&gt;https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/events/tech-challenge/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;interviewing&quot;&gt;Interviewing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Cracking the Coding Interview:&lt;/strong&gt; You really do need to know everything in there. It’s always best to cross-reference when you study, so read other sources that cover the same topics as well. I also recommend the CS Handbook: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecshandbook.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.thecshandbook.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice on HackerRank and LeetCode:&lt;/strong&gt; Start off with the easiest questions and proceed to harder questions at whatever pace is comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two skills needed for coding challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;: Proficiency with the coding language&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;: Knowing what algorithms and data structures you need to solve the underlying problem efficiently&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to do the coding problem on your own at first. If you get stuck on implementation, just Google it. If you get stuck on the algorithms, look up the answer (usually there is a discussion section where people share answers). Do you understand the answer? If not, go back to reviewing Cracking the Coding Interview. If you do understand it, close the answer and try to implement it without looking back at it. Look at multiple answers to see if any of them are easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you understand run-time? You will almost always be asked about the run-time of an algorithm you code in an interview. Make sure you practice identifying run-time while using HackerRank and LeetCode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve practiced on HackerRank and LeetCode enough, try practicing on paper. Make sure you ask yourself the time complexity of your solution. It’s also good practice to come up with your own test cases, even before you start coding. Try talking through your thought processes out loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice with friends. Some clubs like UW Blueprint or engineering societies hold mock interviews. They will likely be advertised on posters or on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for non-coding questions:&lt;/strong&gt; You should be comfortable answering questions about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your past experiences (technologies used, implementation details and decisions)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your courses (coding-related courses especially - you may need to explain course concepts)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your program (you have to sell to the interviewer why your program is good and why you’re passionate about it)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitions (of things like data structures, object oriented programming concepts, recursion, types of tree and graph traversals, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Role-specific concepts (Android, iOS, web, databases, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some companies may also test you on things like:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing test cases&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systems design&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logic puzzles&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behavioural questions (what would you do in this situation?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For non-coding questions, the breadth of topics is very large, so spread out your time evenly when working on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing an interview slot:&lt;/strong&gt; These are micro-optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check WaterlooWorks and your email regularly to see if you have new interviews. You want to get first choice on interview slots, so be ready at all times. Keep your email notifications on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go at a time when both you and the interviewer are going to perform your best. Not too early in the morning, when neither of you are fully ready. Not too late, when the interviewer just wants to go home. Not right before lunch, when the interviewer is hungry&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the interview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember you are also evaluating the company. How much do you actually know about the company? Do you think you would like working for them?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they ask you why you’re interested in working at the company, the easiest generic answers are to state the obvious benefits of working at such a small/big company. You should also talk about why you are passionate about the field of work that the company does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to keep confident. Remember, you either pass the interview or you get good practice for your future interviews. Both are greatly beneficial to you, so be happy with either result. (There is a third possibility: the interview is a waste of time because the interviewer is bad at their job or the company misrepresented the role. Hopefully you still learn what kinds of companies to apply for in the future.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the coding question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start by making sure you understand the question. Ask for clarification if needed. Before you code, write out interesting test cases. The interviewer will confirm if the test cases are correct. Even if you think you understand the problem perfectly, make sure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think over what algorithms and data structures to use. If you have to, brute force this by going over every data structure you know and think about if it makes sense to use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start by coding the easiest thing to implement that comes to mind. Do not worry about the efficiency. Worry instead about how complicated your solution is. Every interview question has a short, easy to understand solution, so if yours is convoluted, try to restart and think of alternate approaches. Otherwise, you likely won’t finish coding, and you likely have many bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the interviewer prompts you, you should immediately go back to your test cases you have already come up with, and run through your code with one of them. Communicate every step to the interviewer. You will likely catch bugs in your code at this point. Catching bugs without any help from the interviewer is great.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now look over your solution and judge its efficiency. Write a more efficient solution if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to communicate your thought processes as much as possible at every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end, ask the interviewer questions:&lt;/strong&gt; This is not a test. This is your opportunity to evaluate the company. Ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What sets the company apart from others? Why did you choose this company?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is an example of a challenging problem you work on?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you like least about working at the company?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you could change one thing about your company or team, what would it be?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(more question examples in Evy’s internship guide!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies will contact you about interviews and offers outside of WaterlooWorks and some don’t. If they do, you’ll likely have the chance to ask about pay later. If they don’t, &lt;strong&gt;ask about pay during the interview.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;choosing-offers&quot;&gt;Choosing Offers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you only have one offer, you need to do some soul-searching: Is taking this offer valuable for your career? Most of this evaluation process is covered by the same tips for applying to companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is a job offer negotiable?&lt;/strong&gt; Companies with lots of interns might be difficult to negotiate with because they don’t want to pay one intern more than others. However, there is no downside to negotiating. The company has already invested a lot to acquiring you, so you can leverage your position to increase your pay, or changing your start and end dates. Ask friends for help with negotiating. I like this resource for learning how to negotiate: &lt;a href=&quot;https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/&quot;&gt;https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;good-habits&quot;&gt;Good Habits&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek help proactively:&lt;/strong&gt; Getting stuck and not seeking help is a total waste of time. Go to office hours, ask friends, and check Piazza (a website Waterloo profs use for Q&amp;amp;As from students).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your calendar to budget your time:&lt;/strong&gt; Anticipate the busiest parts of your term by looking at all the midterms and assignments in your calendar. You don’t normally need to start assignments or studying super early (it’s a lot easier when others have already clarified every detail on Piazza for you to leisurely read), but you will need to start early if your upcoming weeks are incredibly busy. Block out time for working on assignments and studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of your body:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep well, eat well, and take your physical and mental health seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t stop meeting new people:&lt;/strong&gt; The people are the most important thing you get out of university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice learning independently:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t let a bad prof lead to bad grades - you can stay in control by learning from just the lecture slides and reading materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn how to prioritize:&lt;/strong&gt; Getting that last one mark you’re missing in an assignment isn’t worth hours of your time. An interview from a good company is more important than doing well on a midterm (but not more important than at least passing the midterm, obviously). Do not neglect your physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;considerations-for-first-years&quot;&gt;Considerations for First Years&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewers may not even give you coding questions:&lt;/strong&gt; They assume you lack experience and will try to differentiate candidates based on non-coding questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marks matter more in first year:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies can only differentiate first years by marks, since almost everyone has little-to-no experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Bai</name></author><category term="tech" /><summary type="html">This advice is oriented for new or aspiring University of Waterloo students, especially those seeking a career in the tech industry.

&lt;p&gt;Here are twenty photos I liked from the trip. It’s pretty much landscapes, food, and animals. All photos were taken with a Fujifilm X-T2 with the 18-55mm kit lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lima-and-paracas&quot;&gt;Lima and Paracas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;market&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grocery market in Lima. It was not very tourist-friendly, but we were able to navigate it thanks to our food tour guide. We even got to try a variety of local fruits and spices at this market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ice cream&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another stop on the food tour. This chocolate ice cream was made with local cocoa. It was thicker than regular ice cream, but not as thick as a gelato. I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lima coast&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful coast of the Miraflores district in Lima. This was across from the Parque del Amor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barranco bar&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Barranco district in Lima was full of hip bars and restaurants. It was a great place to go after the sun had set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picarones&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picarones are similar to doughnuts, but made from squash and sweet potato, served with syrup. This was at Tio Mario in the Barranco district. A great place for dinner too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paracas&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A national reserve just outside of Paracas. Loved the colours here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arequipa-and-colca-canyon&quot;&gt;Arequipa and Colca Canyon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Arequipa&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arequipa’s Plaza de Armas during sunset. We had to hit up a rooftop restaurant to get this view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of our two-day trek in Colca Canyon, one of the deepest canyons in the world. The views of the mountain ranges were incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stargazing&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hiked down Colca Canyon carrying a tripod just for this shot. It was so worth it; this was the clearest view of the Milky Way I’d ever seen. We had to time our stargazing carefully, because the sky was only this dark for less than two hours between sunset and moonrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dog at sunrise&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple dogs hiked up Colca Canyon with us as the sun was rising, no sweat. How are these dogs so strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sunrise at Colca Canyon&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rising sun’s rays hitting the mountains. Helped make the hike a bit more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Condor&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Andean condor is one of the largest flying birds in the world, and a significant figure in Peruvian folklore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alpaca and llama&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lil alpaca and a llama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;vicuna&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vicunas are the wild ancestors of alpacas, and the national animal of Peru. We couldn’t get very close to them without spooking them, so this was taken in a tour bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cusco-and-the-inca-jungle-trek&quot;&gt;Cusco and the Inca Jungle Trek&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cusco&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunset at Cusco. I loved how the dense housing goes right up the mountains. This view is from a rooftop bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;puppies&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cutest puppy siblings, just chilling at one of the hostels we stayed at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dog&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;inca jungle trek&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure where this is exactly, but it was one of the best views on our 4-day Inca Jungle Trek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/19.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bird&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit me up if you know what species this bird is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peru/20.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;machu picchu&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to get up around 4AM to hike up Machu Picchu for sunrise. The view was unreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s twenty.

Here I’ll share a behind-the-scenes story about how the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allowed me to create ChatStats. Wild, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all starts with me trying to get a copy of my Facebook Messenger data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attempting-to-get-my-chat-data&quot;&gt;Attempting To Get My Chat Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in any data viz project is getting the data. In this case, I needed my message history in a format that a program could easily manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I had a JS script running to scroll up through my chat every few milliseconds. This method of collecting my chat data would have taken days or weeks… per chat! Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final product, ChatStats uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dyi&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Download Your Information (DYI) feature&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to export your entire chat history in a JSON format. Funnily enough, Facebook revamped DYI in late April 2018, and I was trying to use it right before that. There were lots of problems with the old version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was no JSON format available, only HTML&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The web interface to get your data was much uglier and provided less options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were bugs that caused some chat histories to be completely missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the update, I filed a bug about DYI to my friend who was interning at Facebook at the time… so maybe I had something to do with it! Later, I read up on GDPR’s new rules and, uh, nevermind, it was definitely GDPR that led Facebook to make these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-gdpr-played-into-this&quot;&gt;How GDPR Played Into This&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDPR is a new European Union privacy law that went into effect on May 25, 2018. If you haven’t heard of it, you definitely know about all the Privacy Policy update emails you got around that time, which were sent to comply with the new laws. Since large tech companies like Facebook operate globally, it makes sense for them to follow these new laws consistently around the world, rather than treat European users differently, for simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two particularly relevant rights that GDPR bestows on users are the right to access and the right for data portability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right to access&lt;/strong&gt; stipulates that users have the right to access a copy of all the data a company has about them, even if they choose to deactivate their account. This provides the user transparency about what records the service provider is keeping. Facebook’s old DYI tool already allowed users access to their data before GDPR, but it was very buggy and unpolished. In fact, the bugs that caused missing chat histories would have meant that the DYI tool did not properly comply with GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data portability&lt;/strong&gt; means that users must be able to receive their personal data in a machine-readable format. This gives users the ability to easily switch service providers. They can export their data off of the company’s servers and import it into a different service, preventing them from being locked in to a single service provider. To comply with GDPR, Facebook’s DYI tool now supports a JSON format. This made the creation of ChatStats much more feasible, since the data was easier to use and required much less formatting and processing on my part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new rules prompted Facebook to dramatically improve its old, difficult-to-use DYI tool. And thanks to these changes, I was able to create ChatStats and make a cool blog post for my girlfriend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that when governments and activists fight for better data privacy, we also get to use our data in more powerful ways. Without Facebook’s improved DYI feature, ChatStats couldn’t have existed. I imagine Reddit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/&quot;&gt;/r/DataIsBeautiful subreddit&lt;/a&gt; is going to get a lot of great new content thanks to GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As every major tech company is GDPR compliant by now, it’s now easy to download your chat history in machine-readable formats from other apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Twitter. It would only take some minor tweaking to convert that data into the JSON format that ChatStats uses. (If you’re interested in using ChatStats for chats in other applications, let me know!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neat projects like ChatStats are a fun by-product of the important work that governments and activists do to ensure the ethical use of our data! The relatively unregulated internet that we know now will look very different in the coming years. Hopefully, the internet will continue to change to further empower users.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Bai</name></author><category term="tech" /><summary type="html">In my last post, I shared my first data viz project, ChatStats.

I’m privileged to have had so many unique opportunities and experiences throughout these fourteen trimesters, both in my career and personal life. I’ve also met so many amazing people that I’m lucky to call my friends. In fact, I happened to meet my soon-to-be best friend during the first week of university, and now we’ve been dating for over four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To commemorate spending all of my university life with Camille, I made some data visualizations of our Facebook messages. This involved analyzing over 152,000 messages that span from October 2013 up until April 2018. Let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;graphs&quot;&gt;Graphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/number-of-messages-sent.png&quot; alt=&quot;messages sent&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/average-number-of-words-per-message.png&quot; alt=&quot;words per message&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camille messages more, but at least I have more words per message… Hope that makes up for the difference. 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/messages-by-weekday.png&quot; alt=&quot;messages by weekday&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/messages-by-hour-of-day.png&quot; alt=&quot;messages by hour of day&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camille messages more at every hour and every day of the week… except for 5AM. Probably because of my bad sleep habits, or the timezone difference from when I was traveling. I swear Camille has a weirder sleeping schedule, but the stats don’t lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/messages-by-trimester.png&quot; alt=&quot;messages by hour of day&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As anyone from UWaterloo knows, UW students’ lives are divided into four month chunks, where we alternate between school and co-op. This involves a lot of moving around, so our texting habits are bound to vary a lot every trimester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trimesters with the most messages all occurred when we were super long-distance. I was in California in Fall 2016 and Fall 2017, and I was in Singapore in Winter 2017. Probably the life story of too many UWaterloo couples lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/days-with-the-most-messages.png&quot; alt=&quot;top days messages&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top three were just average days while we were long-distance. On the top day, April 7th 2017, I started binging The Get Down on Netflix, and I was live-texting her my reactions. (why did they cancel it?? 😭)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth and fifth days were very recent; it looks like we were procrastinating by talking to each other instead of studying for our exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/most-frequent-emoji.png&quot; alt=&quot;most frequent emoji&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of sad faces. I guess we’re both stressed out and anxious a lot in university, so please don’t read too much into it LMAO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, note how I’m clearly the more positive and affectionate person. Where my heart emojis at, Camille??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/most-frequent-stickers.png&quot; alt=&quot;most frequent stickers&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m constantly serenading Camille with romantic stickers, but she never reciprocates. Wish my gf’s sticker game was stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/names-said-in-chat.png&quot; alt=&quot;names said in chat&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does Camille say my name so much? I know you’re talking to me, we’re the only two people here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/chatstats/our-most-distinguishing-words.png&quot; alt=&quot;most distinguishing words&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quantify distinctiveness of our words, I computed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf&quot;&gt;TF-IDF&lt;/a&gt; values of every word. If a word has a higher score for a person, that means that word is more likely to be spoken by that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fun to see how we talk differently. She likes to leave off the G in “-ing” words. I say “whoa” and she says “woah”. I say “8:30” and she says “830”. I didn’t realize we complained about early classes so often for it to be statistically relevant though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made a similar graph for most distinguishing words per trimester. It was a blast looking through it with Camille, but it exposes us too hard to share here, haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were all of the most interesting graphs I managed to make! Camille, thank you for all the experiences we’ve shared during university, and the many more to come. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-make-your-own-graphs&quot;&gt;How To Make Your Own Graphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see these graphs for your own Facebook messages, you’re in luck. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baieric/chatstats&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try out ChatStats on Github to make your own data visualizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ChatStats even works with group chats, which are also incredibly fun to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with coding experience: the code is easy to modify and extend, so you can quickly put together new types of graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do try out ChatStats, let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll provide background information, detailed examples, code, and references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning is a field of machine learning in which a software agent is taught to maximize its acquisition of rewards in a given environment. Observations of the state of the environment are used by the agent to make decisions about which action it should perform in order to maximize its reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning has recently garnered significant news coverage as a result of innovations in deep Q-networks (DQNs) by DeepMind Technologies. Through deep reinforcement learning, DeepMind was able to teach computers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html&quot;&gt;play Atari games better than humans&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo&quot;&gt;defeat one of the top Go players in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-data/assets/papers/DeepMindNature14236Paper.pdf#page=10&quot;&gt;DeepMind’s paper&lt;/a&gt;, an “informal search” for hyperparameter values was conducted in order to avoid the high computational cost of performing grid search. Because the complexity of grid search grows exponentially with the number of parameters being tuned, experts often spend considerable time and resources performing these “informal searches.” This may lead to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nervanasys.com/sigopt/&quot;&gt;suboptimal performance&lt;/a&gt;, or can lead to the systems not being tuned at all. Bayesian optimization represents a way to efficiently optimize these high dimensional, time consuming, and expensive problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate the power of hyperparameter optimization by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.sigopt.com/&quot;&gt;SigOpt&lt;/a&gt;’s ensemble of state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization techniques to tune a DQN. We’ll show how this approach finds better hyperparameter values much faster than traditional methods such as grid and random search, without requiring expert time spent doing “informal” hand tuning of parameters. The DQN under consideration will be used to solve a classic learning control problem called the Cart-Pole problem &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In this problem, a pole must be balanced upright on a cart for as long as possible. To simulate this environment, we will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://gym.openai.com/&quot;&gt;OpenAI’s Gym library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bayesian-optimization/cart-pole.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;‍&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; A rendered episode from the OpenAI Gym’s Cart-Pole environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenAI Gym provides a common interface to various reinforcement learning environments; the code written for this post (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sigopt/sigopt-examples/tree/master/reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;available on Github&lt;/a&gt;) can be easily modified to solve other learning control problems from the Gym’s environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-environment&quot;&gt;The Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In OpenAI’s simulation of the cart-pole problem, the software agent controls the movement of the cart, earning a &lt;strong&gt;reward&lt;/strong&gt; of +1 for each timestep until the terminating step. A terminating step occurs when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical or if the cart has moved more than 2.4 units from the center. The agent receives 4 continuous values that make up the &lt;strong&gt;state&lt;/strong&gt; of the environment at each timestep: the position of the cart on the track, the angle of the pole, the cart velocity, and the rate of change of the angle. The agent’s only possible &lt;strong&gt;actions&lt;/strong&gt; at each timestep are to push the cart to the left or right by applying a force of either -1 or +1, respectively. A series of states and actions, ending in a terminating state, is known as an &lt;strong&gt;episode&lt;/strong&gt;. The agent will have no prior concept about the meaning of the values that represent these states and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-learning&quot;&gt;Q-learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q-learning is a reinforcement learning technique that develops an action-value function (also known as the Q-function) that returns an expected utility of an action given a current state. Thus, the policy of the agent is to take the action with the highest expected utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume there exists an all-knowing Q-function that always selects the best action for a given state. Through Q-learning, we construct an approximation of this all-knowing function by continually updating the approximation using the results of previously attempted actions. The Q-learning algorithm updates the Q-function iteratively, as is explained below; initial Q-values are arbitrarily selected. An existing expected utility is updated when given new information using the following algorithm&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;Q_{t+1}(s_t, a_t) = Q_t(s_t, a_t) + \alpha(r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_a( Q_t(s_{t+1}, a)) - Q_t(s_t, a_t)).&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$a_t$ is the action executed in the state $s_t$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$s_{t+1}$ is the new state observed. In a deterministic environment&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it is a function of $s_t$ and $a_t$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$r_{t+1}$ is the immediate reward gained. It is a function of $s_t$, $a_t$, and $s_{t+1}$.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\alpha$ is the constant learning rate; how much the new information is weighted relative to the old information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\gamma$ is the constant discount factor that determines how much long-term rewards should be valued.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its simplest form, the Q-function can be implemented as a table mapping all possible combinations of states and actions to expected utility values. Since this is infeasible in environments with large or continuous action and observation spaces, we use a neural net to approximate this lookup table. As the agent continues act within the environment, the estimated Q-function is updated to better approximate the true Q-function via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation&quot;&gt;backpropagation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-objective-metric&quot;&gt;The Objective Metric&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To properly tune the hyperparameters of our DQN, we have to select an appropriate objective metric value for SigOpt to optimize. While we are primarily concerned with maximizing the agent’s reward acquisition, we must also consider the DQN’s stability and efficiency. To ensure our agent’s training is efficient, we will train the DQN over the course of only 350 episodes and record the total reward accumulated for each episode. We use a rolling average of the reward for each set of 100 consecutive episodes (episodes 1 to 100, 2 to 101, etc.) and take the maximum for our objective metric. This helps stabilize the agent’s learning while also giving a robust metric for the overall quality of the agent with respect to the reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tunable-parameters-of-reinforcement-learning-via-deep-q-networks&quot;&gt;Tunable Parameters of Reinforcement Learning Via Deep Q-Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many tunable hyperparameters in the realm of reinforcement learning and deep Q-networks&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, for this blog post the following 7 parameters&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were selected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;minibatch_size:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of training cases used to update the Q-network at each training step. These training cases, or minibatches, are randomly selected from the agent’s replay memory. In our implementation, the replay memory contains the last 1,000,000 transitions in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;epsilon_decay_steps:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of episodes required for the initial $\epsilon$ value to linearly decay until it reaches its end value. $\epsilon$ is the probability that our agent takes a random action, which decreases over time to balance exploration and exploitation. The upper bound for this parameter depends on the total number of episodes run. Initially, $\epsilon$ is 1, and it will decrease until it is 0.1, as suggested in DeepMind’s paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hidden_multiplier:&lt;/strong&gt; Determines the number of nodes in the hidden layers of the Q-network. We set the number of nodes by multiplying this value by the size of the observation space. We formulated this parameter in this way to make it easier to switch to environments with different observation spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;initial_weight_stddev&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;intial_bias_stddev:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the Q-network’s weights and biases are randomly initialized from normal distributions with a mean of 0. The standard deviations of these distributions affect the rate of convergence of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;learning_rate:&lt;/strong&gt; Regulates the speed and accuracy of the Q-network by controlling the rate at which the weights of the network are updated. We look at this parameter on the logarithmic scale. This is equivalent to $\alpha$ in the Q-learning formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;discount_factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Determines the importance of future rewards to the agent. A value closer to zero will place more importance on short-term rewards, and a value closer to 1 will place more importance on long-term rewards. This is equivalent to $\gamma$ in the Q-learning formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other good hyperparameters to consider tuning are the minimum epsilon value, the replay memory size, and the number of episodes of pure exploration (&lt;strong&gt;_final_epsilon&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;_replay_memory_size&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;_episodes_pure_exploration&lt;/strong&gt; in the Agent class).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-code&quot;&gt;The Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sigopt/sigopt-examples/tree/master/reinforcement-learning&quot;&gt;The code is available on Github&lt;/a&gt;. The only dependencies required to run this example are NumPy, Gym, TensorFlow, and SigOpt. If you don’t have a SigOpt account, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://sigopt.com/signup&quot;&gt;sign up for a free SigOpt trial&lt;/a&gt;. SigOpt also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.sigopt.com/edu&quot;&gt;a free plan available for academic users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running this code can be computationally intensive. If possible, try running this example on a CPU optimized machine. On a c4.4xlarge AWS instance, the entire example can take up to 5 hours to run. If you are running the code on an AWS instance, you can try using the SigOpt Community AMI that includes several pre-installed machine learning libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We compared the results of SigOpt’s Bayesian optimization to two standard hyperparameter tuning methods: grid search and random search&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn6&quot; id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. 128 objective evaluations for each optimization method were run, and we took the median of 5 runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;SigOpt&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Random Search&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Grid Search&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Best Found&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;847.19&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;569.93&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;194.62&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1:&lt;/strong&gt; SigOpt outperforms random search and grid search.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bayesian-optimization/best-trace.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The best seen trace of hyperparameter tuning methods over the course of 128 objective evaluations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SigOpt does dramatically better than random search and grid search! For fun, let’s look at the performance of the DQN with the best configuration found by SigOpt. Below are snapshots showing the progress of the sample network’s evolution over the 350 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bayesian-optimization/ep64.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Episode 64 of 350. The pole tilts too far, ending the episode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bayesian-optimization/ep125.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Episode 125 of 350. The cart goes too far in one direction, ending the episode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bayesian-optimization/ep216.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5&quot; style=&quot;max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Episode 216 of 350. The agent performs well. The video cuts off before the agent fails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown above, the agent initially has trouble keeping the pole balanced. Eventually, it learns that it can go in the direction that the pole is angled in order to prevent it from falling over immediately. However, the cart would then travel too far in one direction, another failure condition. Finally, the agent learns to move just enough to swing the pole the opposite way so that it is not constantly travelling in a single direction. This is the power of tuning &lt;strong&gt;discount_factor&lt;/strong&gt; effectively!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-remarks&quot;&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization, we were able to achieve better performance than otherwise possible with standard search methods. The example code presented in this post is easily adaptable to explore more computationally intensive tasks. We encourage you to try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementing more sophisticated DQN features to improve performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuning a greater number of hyperparameters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attempting more complicated games from the OpenAI Gym, such as Acrobot-v1 and LunarLander-v0. Our code currently supports games with a discrete action space and a 1-D array of continuous states for the observation space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tuning a DQN to maximize general performance in multiple environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you try!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s particularly useful for sharing quotes from web articles. Xcerpt’s goal is to allow you to show what the link contains, making it easier for you to engage your followers with links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on it on-and-off for about two months (and during exams too!), and I wanted to share my development and design process: what technical problems I faced, what design decisions I made, and what I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-decision-to-create-xcerpt&quot;&gt;The decision to create Xcerpt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early June, I started following Anil Dash on Twitter. Anil shares a lot of links using an iOS app called OneShot. When I learned about OneShot, the first thing I did was look up whether it had an Android version (nope), and then looked up if there were any similar apps on the Play Store (nope). The decision to make “OneShot for Android” was pretty straightforward from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Xcerpt, I had some beginner experience with Android dev, but they never made it past the “it just barely works” stage of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was different. The main appeal was how small the project was. Small meant it was manageable to work on during school. Small meant I could see its development from minimum viable product to fully fleshed out on the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-first-step-getting-input-from-theuser&quot;&gt;The first step: getting input from the user&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My strategy from the get-go was to make progress in very incremental steps. In OneShot, you can highlight text on an image. This involved custom touch events and custom views, stuff I had no idea how to do when I started. Instead, I opted to have the user copy and paste text, or select text in a browser and then use the Share button to send it to my app. Not as fancy, much more finicky, but would get the job done. I called that page PasteActivity, the precursor to Xcerpt’s current InputActivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/first-android-app/input_activity.png&quot; alt=&quot;PasteActivity, on the left, would eventually become InputActivity, on the right.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Paste page, on the left, would eventually become the Input page, on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PasteActivity was just an edit field, with Paste and Delete buttons for the user to make common actions in one tap. With this layout, the user could paste some text and then edit it however they like. In the end, I decided this was too much control over the input for the user; the edge cases where the user would have to manually edit text were too unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current version of Xcerpt, there’s a simple paste button that takes you straight to customizing your image, no other steps involved. Simplicity meant a tradeoff of user input control for speed and intuitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-everything-happens-the-customization-page&quot;&gt;Where everything happens: The customization page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interface for the customization page includes tabbed pages for colour selection and source selection at the top, with the preview of the image on the bottom. This design did not really change at all throughout development. I briefly tried out an alternate layout where the Colour and Source pages were in pop-ups, in an attempt to give the image preview more screen space, but ultimately decided the extra taps to open pop ups weren’t worth it. While the design was straightforward, this page was challenging due to how much is going on in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/first-android-app/customize_activity.png&quot; alt=&quot;CustomizeActivity, which hardly changed from how it first looked.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the user inputs the text they want to share, Xcerpt performs a web search of the text to find its source, then processes the search results to display to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early dilemma I faced was that most Search APIs cost a lot of money. I pretty much only had one option, Bing, which provides 5000 free searches per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One unfortunate “gotcha” of Bing’s Search API is the undocumented max URL length of the API call. I had to use up some precious searches to see how long my query could be before an error is thrown. This was complicated by the fact that certain characters become longer when URL-encoded (for example, a space becomes “%20”). I’m still not sure how I should be handling extremely long inputs at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pre-process the user’s input a bit before performing a search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove all quotation marks, which Bing would interpret as wanting verbatim search&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace all whitespace with a regular space, so that there are only single spaces between each search word&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrap the string (which currently has no quotation marks) in quotation marks so that Bing verbatim searches the entire input for better search results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcerpt queries for the top 3 results to provide as options for the user. This was my first time making an asynchronous task in Android, but it wasn’t too long before it worked. Bing returned some JSON that looked like this for each result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;__metadata&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;uri&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;https:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;api.datamarket.azure.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Data.ashx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Bing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;SearchWeb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Web?Query='Alphabet will operate as the parent company for a number of smaller companies, including Google, which will continue to focus on Internet products.

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Url&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;http:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;money.cnn.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;alphabet-google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;index.html&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Bing truncates a title if it’s too long, and I wanted to display the entire title for the user. Additionally, I would prefer to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ogp.me/&quot;&gt;OG:Title&lt;/a&gt; if the site had one, since it’s the actual title of the web page’s content. So Bing’s title was junk. I had to write another asynchronous task to fetch the HTML from the site and get its title. Sometimes, the HTML results only contained scripts that would load the full HTML later, meaning I wouldn’t find a title. I used the Bing search result’s title as a fallback in this case. Other than this complication, processing the search results simply involved string parsing of the title, DisplayUrl, and URL, which I stored in an Article object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the user is done customizing, they reach the Share page. I’m pretty proud of the layout of this page; I feel all the information is laid out nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/first-android-app/share_activity.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Share page.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a love-hate relationship with the Twitter API when integrating it into Xcerpt. Twitter’s Fabric platform was incredibly friendly to use — the Android Studio extension made adding set-up code as simple as possible. However, some features were limited. Fabric didn’t let you post to Twitter from inside the app. Instead, it would try to open up Twitter’s compose tweet page and fill it in. This meant another tap for the user (press Tweet and then… press Tweet again in Twitter). It also couldn’t attach the image if you used a third-party Twitter app. When I emailed Fabric support asking why this limitation existed, they stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We require the composer [in the official Twitter app] just so that users are always aware of what apps are posting on their behalf- they get pretty upset otherwise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a reasonable argument, but I make it as clear as possible in my app when Xcerpt is tweeting something for you. In the end I had to use the unofficial library twitter4j to post the tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One little feature on this page that OneShot didn’t have: the Tweet button is replaced with a “View on Twitter” button after you’re done tweeting. It streamlines a user’s typical work flow, and it’s a nice touch that OneShot ought to consider adding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-screenshots-as-an-inputmethod&quot;&gt;Adding screenshots as an input method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had completely finished the app at this point. It worked and had a polished look. However, I wasn’t completely satisfied — selecting text on a browser can often be annoying and laggy on poorly made mobile sites, and I hated how this aspect of the user workflow, which I couldn’t control, made using Xcerpt a less than ideal experience. So I started integrating the next feature: providing input with screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Square’s Picasso image library to show a list of screenshots (side note: I love the work Square is doing to create great Android libraries!). For cropping the image, there were plenty of open source image crop tools, but there was a problem with all of them: The crop frame overlay would start out as a small rectangle in the middle of the image. I needed the frame to be as wide as the original image, since the user would mostly be cropping vertically only. I ended up customizing a library for the first time, which was a good learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I had to read text from the image. To achieve this, I used Tesseract, an open source optical character recognition library. This was a headache to set-up — getting it working involved compiling C++ code so that it would work on Android. Tesseract also needs a huge file (&amp;gt;20MB) to train it to recognize English, which Xcerpt downloads when the user first opens the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a user will do something I don’t expect them to do: select an image that doesn’t contain text. Tesseract will look for characters in the image and find gibberish. I didn’t want this gibberish to show up in the customization page. The problem, then, is how can I tell if the string I get from Tesseract is not actual text? I came up with a quick solution that worked surprisingly well: find out what percent of the text is alphanumeric. Some quick testing showed that actual paragraphs were always &amp;gt;90% alphanumeric, while strings from images of Google Maps, phone backgrounds, and my snapchats (all gibberish) varied around 55%. I decided to reject anything below 75%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was finally done my first Android app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I understand Android and Tesseract better, I hope to integrate some improvements to Xcerpt in the future. The next big feature is to use the screenshot itself in the image, like OneShot. This involves highlighting the text on the image directly. Tesseract can provide the coordinates of each character, word, and line. I need to use these coordinates with custom touch events and an overlay of the image to add highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also listening to feedback from Xcerpt users. One commonly suggested feature that I’ll be adding soon is a “Save Image” button, for when the user wants to make the image but tweet it at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;special-thanks&quot;&gt;Special thanks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a lot of help designing Xcerpt thanks to the suggestions and support of Camille Macalalad, Andy Baek, David Fu, and Richard Wong. Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s particularly useful for sharing quotes from web articles. Xcerpt’s goal is to allow you to show what the link contains, making it easier for you to engage your followers with links.</summary></entry></feed>
