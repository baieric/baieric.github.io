          <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://ericbai.co/2018/05/10/i-made-some-data-visualizations-for-my-girlfriend/&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt;, I shared my first data viz project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baieric/chatstats&quot;&gt;ChatStats&lt;/a&gt;. Here I’ll share a behind-the-scenes story about how the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allowed me to create ChatStats. Wild, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Made Some Data Visualizations For My Girlfriend</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished my undergrad last month, and it’s really sinking in how special and fleeting the past five years have been. I’m privileged to have had so many unique opportunities and experiences throughout these fourteen trimesters, both in my career and personal life. I’ve also met so many amazing people that I’m lucky to call my friends. In fact, I happened to meet my soon-to-be best friend during the first week of university, and now we’ve been dating for over four years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Bayesian Optimization for Reinforcement Learning</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will show you how &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.sigopt.com/2d66b84dcdbbd7fffad087f58b67a585eb89444c/pdf/SigOpt_Bayesian_Optimization_Primer.pdf&quot;&gt;Bayesian optimization&lt;/a&gt; was able to dramatically improve the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm in an AI challenge. We’ll provide background information, detailed examples, code, and references.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My First Android App: The Development Process</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 30th, I released &lt;a href=&quot;http://xcerpt.surge.sh/&quot;&gt;Xcerpt&lt;/a&gt;, an Android app for sharing links on Twitter attached with an eye-catching image of some content from the link. It’s particularly useful for sharing quotes from web articles. Xcerpt’s goal is to allow you to show what the link contains, making it easier for you to engage your followers with links.&lt;/p&gt;
